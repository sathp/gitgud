### What is Version Control?

Version control is a system for keeping track of changes you’ve made to a file over a period of time. 

### Why do we NEED it?

-  Software development is an iterative process. Having the ability to store versions and variations of code we’re writing allows us to go to look at older versions. Create checkpoints when we’re able to implement specific ideas and do a lot more.
-  It’s also a collaborative process. Version control systems like git allow us to leverage the power of collaboration. They allow us to work with other individually. Share the work that we’ve done with each other.
-  And most importantly, it allows us to put our work together. It allows us to merge work done by team members around the simultaneously into one codebase without duplication and errors.
